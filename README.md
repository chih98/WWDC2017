# WWDC2017
This is my WWDC 2017 Playground submission. Essentially it takes a text file, assignes a value to each word, and then creates a color and note for the word and plays through the txt file.

> If you have an idea, feel free to ring me and I will create a new repo for a modified version that you can fork from!
